# Admin Dashboard using MERN Stack
The main goal of this project is to practice the use of **MERN technical stack**, and **manipulate data**.

The aim of this project is to create an online sales-oriented Full-Stack Admin Dashboard.

For this project, I followed the [EdRoh](https://www.youtube.com/@EdRohDev)'s [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cPCMIuDk2I&ab_channel=EdRoh), taking a few liberties.

So what is MERN ?

## Technical Stack

MERN is a technical stack that uses the following technologies :

> - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) : Document-oriented NoSQL database management system.
> - [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) : Web application Framework for NodeJS.
> - [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) : Open-source JS library for building UIs.
> - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) : Open-source cross-platform JS runtime envirronment.

### Front-End :

> - [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/) : React UI tool.
> - [Nivo](https://nivo.rocks/) : Charts package.
> - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) : Open-source JS library for centralized status management.

### Back-End :

> - [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) : MongoDB object modeling for NodeJS.

## Various pages

This different pages display various information, such as products, customers, transactions, sales and other administration information.

Most of this information is summarized on the Dashboard, which is the Landing page.

## ENV File example (./.env)

> PORT = 5000
>
> MONGO_URI = _**link**_
>
> NODE_ENV = development
