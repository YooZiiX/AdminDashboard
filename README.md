# Admin Dashboard using MERN Stack
The main goal of this project is to practice the use of **MERN technical stack**, and **manipulate data**.

The aim of this project is to create an online sales-oriented Full-Stack Admin Dashboard.

For this project, I followed the [EdRoh](https://www.youtube.com/@EdRohDev)'s [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cPCMIuDk2I&ab_channel=EdRoh), taking a few liberties.

So what is MERN ?
